###Here's a 100-day roadmap to learning Next.js with a focus on blockchain development:

***Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1–30)

Days 1–10: Introduction to Next.js and JavaScript Fundamentals

Day 1-2: Understand what Next.js is, install Node.js, and set up your development environment.

Day 3-5: Review JavaScript basics (variables, functions, arrays, objects).

Day 6-8: Learn about ES6+ features like arrow functions, destructuring, and async/await.

Day 9-10: Build a basic "Hello World" app in Next.js.

Days 11–20: Core Concepts of Next.js

Day 11-13: Learn about pages, routing, and linking in Next.js.

Day 14-16: Study Next.js' file-based routing, dynamic routes, and nested routes.

Day 17-20: Understand components, layouts, and reusable components.

Days 21–30: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and API Routes

Day 21-23: Explore SSR and Static Site Generation (SSG) in Next.js.

Day 24-26: Learn about API routes in Next.js and create a simple API.

Day 27-30: Review this phase and create a mini-project using SSR and API routes.

***Phase 2: Intermediate Skills (Days 31–60)

Days 31–40: Data Fetching and State Management

Day 31-34: Study data fetching methods in Next.js, like getStaticProps, getServerSideProps.

Day 35-37: Learn about state management in React (using Context API or Zustand).

Day 38-40: Create a mini-project with server-side and client-side data fetching.

Days 41–50: Connecting to Blockchain

Day 41-43: Install and explore web3.js and ethers.js for Ethereum interaction.

Day 44-47: Set up a simple smart contract on a testnet (e.g., Sepolia or Rinkeby).

Day 48-50: Integrate your Next.js app with MetaMask and connect to the blockchain.

Days 51–60: Authentication and User Accounts

Day 51-54: Learn about authentication methods (wallet connect, JWTs, session management).

Day 55-57: Implement basic wallet authentication (e.g., MetaMask login).

Day 58-60: Build a user profile page using wallet-based authentication.

***Phase 3: Advanced Concepts (Days 61–90)

Days 61–70: Advanced Routing, SEO, and Optimization

Day 61-64: Study advanced routing concepts in Next.js.

Day 65-67: Learn about SEO in Next.js (meta tags, dynamic head content).

Day 68-70: Optimize app performance and understand image optimization in Next.js.

Days 71–80: Integrating Smart Contracts with Next.js

Day 71-75: Write a simple smart contract (e.g., ERC-20 token) and deploy it on a testnet.

Day 76-78: Connect the contract with your Next.js frontend, allowing users to interact (like transferring tokens).

Day 79-80: Test and debug the contract integration.

Days 81–90: Deploying to Production

Day 81-84: Learn about deployment options (Vercel, Netlify).

Day 85-87: Deploy a test version of your app.

Day 88-90: Troubleshoot, optimize, and finalize the deployment.

---

***Phase 4: Project and Review (Days 91–100)

Days 91–95: Final Project

Build a decentralized application (dApp) that includes:

Wallet-based login.

Interactions with a smart contract.

Basic transaction history.

Days 96–100: Review and Improve

Day 96-98: Review your project, add documentation, and ensure code is clean.

Day 99-100: Seek feedback, reflect on what you’ve learned, and explore areas for further improvement.
